## Welcome to the metric converter.

To get started you can type 'commands' to see all the different conversions available,
or read up on them below:

## [All commands]
- 'km > mi'
- 'c > f'
- 'kph > mph'
- 'L > gal'

To use a command just enter the 'metric unit' you want, a 'greater than sign',
the 'imperial unit' you want to convert to, and then it will ask you how many you want to convert.
